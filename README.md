# Getting Started

In terminal, run command `npm install` to install dependencies and then `npm run dev` to launch site. The site has a mock back end connected to a local sqlite database to demonstrate:
  - Create User
  - Find User
  - Edit User
  - Export All Users

## Incomplete Functions for Further Discussion

The 'Bulk Create User' and 'Bulk Edit User' pages allow for local file selection, but do not currently add rows to the mock database. The engineering team should discuss how these functions should run (can full CSV file be sent to the backend to be parsed and added row by row?)

For the mock up, upload and save brings the user to a submitted page that randomly shows success or error messages.

## In Progress Features/Initiatives
- Generic ControlledSelectInput is in progress
- Remove repetitive code
